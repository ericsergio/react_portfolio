                    A few years ago, when the older of my two daughters was 1 years old, I decided that I needed to pursue a new career that I would be passionate about and that would enable me to provide my daughters with more of my time and financial security. 
                    I was already passionate about software development and spent a great deal of my free time learning various programming languages. I love building, testing, tinkering, customizing, and generally solving the puzzles that software development presents. 
                    I began by working with VBA which led to SQL, C#, JavaScript and everything from AutoHotkey to Selenium. I am most proficient working with JavaScript, C#, Bash, and SQL. I prefer using UNIX/Linux but am just as capable working in Windows and am far more comfortable using a shell over a UI. 
                    I am proficient using cloud technologies and am in the final portion of completing the Google Cloud Cyber Security certification. Along with my technical skillset, I have a great deal of experience from working in a high-volume, fast-paced and high-stress restaurant environment, that includes teamwork, leadership, multi-tasking and more. Some of my hobbies include playing basketball, coaching my daughterâ€™s soccer team, skateboarding, and everything involved from being a parent. 
                    I built this website from scratch and am hosting it via a Google Compute Engine virtual machine. Thank you for visiting!</span>
